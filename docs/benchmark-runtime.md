# kotlinx.benchmark: A Comprehensive Guide to Benchmark Runtime for Each Target

This document provides an in-depth overview of the kotlinx.benchmark library, focusing on how the benchmark runtime works for each supported target: JVM, JavaScript, and Native. This guide is designed for beginners and intermediates, providing a clear understanding of the underlying libraries used and the benchmark execution process.

## JVM Target

The JVM target in kotlinx.benchmark leverages the Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH) to run benchmarks. JMH is a widely-used tool for building, running, and analyzing benchmarks written in Java and other JVM languages.

### Benchmark Execution

JMH handles the execution of benchmarks, managing the setup, running, and teardown of tests. It also handles the calculation of results, providing a robust and reliable framework for benchmarking on the JVM.

### Benchmark Configuration

The benchmark configuration is handled through annotations that map directly to JMH annotations. These include `@State`, `@Benchmark`, `@BenchmarkMode`, `@OutputTimeUnit`, `@Warmup`, `@Measurement`, and `@Param`.

### File Operations

File reading and writing operations are performed using standard Java I/O classes, providing a consistent and reliable method for file operations across all JVM platforms.

## JavaScript Target

The JavaScript target in kotlinx.benchmark leverages the Benchmark.js library to run benchmarks. Benchmark.js is a robust tool for executing JavaScript benchmarks in different environments, including browsers and Node.js.

### Benchmark Execution

Benchmark.js handles the execution of benchmarks, managing the setup, running, and teardown of tests. Just like JMH for JVM, it also handles the calculation of results, providing a reliable framework for benchmarking on JavaScript.

### Benchmark Configuration

The benchmark configuration in JavaScript is handled through a suite and benchmark API provided by benchmark.js. The API allows the users to specify the details of the benchmark such as the function to benchmark, setup function, and teardown function.

### File Operations

File reading and writing operations in JavaScript are performed using the standard JavaScript file I/O APIs. This includes the fs module in Node.js or the File API in browsers.

## Native Target

The Native target in kotlinx.benchmark leverages the built-in benchmarking capabilities of the Kotlin/Native runtime to execute benchmarks.

### Benchmark Execution

Kotlin/Native manages the execution of benchmarks, handling the setup, running, and teardown of tests. Just like JMH for JVM and Benchmark.js for JavaScript, Kotlin/Native also takes care of the calculation of results, providing a reliable framework for benchmarking in a native environment.

### Benchmark Configuration

The benchmark configuration in Kotlin/Native is handled through annotations that are similar to those used in the JVM target. These include `@State`, `@Benchmark`, `@BenchmarkMode`, `@OutputTimeUnit`, `@Warmup`, `@Measurement`, and `@Param`.

### File Operations

File operations in the Native target are handled through Kotlin's standard file I/O APIs. These APIs are compatible with all platforms supported by Kotlin/Native, providing a consistent method for file operations.
